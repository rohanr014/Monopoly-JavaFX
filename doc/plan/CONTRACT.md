# Monopoly Final Project - Team 1 Contract

1. Team meetings
    - Meetings Tuesdays 5-7, West.
    - If late or absent, text as soon as possible, and commit to doing the reasonable amount of work assigned to you during the meeting.

2. Communication
    - Our main channel of commmunication will be via an iMessage group chat.
    - It is each individuals responsibility to be active on group message. If asked a direct question asked towards you, there should be a response within 24 hrs.

3. Assisting others
    - Since this is **our** _group_ project we will each ask each other for help when we needed it and other members of the group will go beyond their expections and help out where they can

4. Responsibility and Accountability
    - It is our goal to be committed and on time not only for each hard deadline as assigned by our professors but also for the deadlines that we apply internally.
    - If you are behind, say something sooner rather than later and weâ€™ll all try to help. If you notice someone is behind, offer to help.
    - If a teammate is not doing work, after a team discussion and a discussion with the person in question, we will go to the instructors as a group.
