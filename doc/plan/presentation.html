            <section><p><strong>Primary design goals of the project (i.e., where is it most flexible)</strong>
The primary design goal of our project is to be able to implement a basic game of Monopoly in such a way that we can
easily expand, build upon, or modify any of the aspects in our game that a player would want to change. For instance,
in addition to being able to customize cosmetic options and the names/appearances of properties, we also want to allow
players to change various rules to fit their preferences, such as limitless cash and housing, doubling the reward for landing
on Go, or even playing with auctions or not. Put simply, we want to make anything that a player would want to change to be
flexible, so that we can implement as many different kinds of games as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Primary architecture of the design (i.e., what is closed and what is open)</strong>
The fundamental parts of the game that are common to all Monopoly games will most likely remain closed throughout our
development process (like Wallet and Dice), as will the many abstract classes that we will build to make variations 
of the game that we write early on (like Property and Space). Along those same lines, the only open components will be
the larger classes that will be responsible for managing newer features like Board and Player, as we start to add interactions
like trading and auctioning, as we would need added functionality to handle those. Whether we decide to add that to existing
classes or to make new classes that take care of those new features, we will have to change certain classes that manage
the interactions between certain pairs of entities in order to accommodate those new features.</p></section>

            <section><p><strong>Discuss the design at a high-level (i.e., without referencing specific classes, data structures, or code).</strong>
To start our design out, we plan to implement just about everything abstractly, which will give us a good sense on what should
be able to be customized/changed for different games, and what will remain constant. Doing so will also allow us to organize
our hierarchies early on, which is definitely going to be essential as the project grows and more features are added. We
plan to use an MVC approach as we did for the Simulation project, in which we have a game engine that will handle the 
interactions between different objects and the resulting changes in game state/data, a view in which users will directly
interact with the game to prompt those changes, and a controller to delegate actions from the user to the model. The game
engine will consist of both abstract and concrete classes and will be the backbone of the project. It will contain the
components that will advance the game as well as the ones that will be responsible for producing different playable
variations of the game. The view will be built on top of the abstractions defined by these classes to make sure it is
as flexible as possible and so that the use of new instances that extend our abstract classes will not require changes to
the view in order to change our game.</p></section>

            <section><p><strong>Map of your design for other programmers to gain a general understanding of how and why the program was divided up, and 
how the individual parts work together to provide the desired functionality.</strong>
The biggest/main class of our model is the Board class, which will contain the players playing the game (including the
bank, which we are treating as a player since they too are an entity that is simply dishing out money to others), the Space
objects, and the Card objects. The board will be responsible for moving the different players and holding their positions.
Each player will possess a wallet variable to keep track of their money and handle monetary transactions, as well as a set of
assets that will store the properties they own and any other holdable cards they may possess, like get out of jail free.
There will be two kinds of spaces - properties, and common spaces. Properties can either
be SetProps (like Railroads and Utilities, which can't be built upon and the rent that is charged to them depends heavily
upon how many are owned), and ColorProps (all the other properties in the game that can be built upon). The other kind
of Space is CommonSpace, which will represent all the un-ownable spaces on the board, like Chance, Community Chest,
Super Tax, and Go. </p>
<p>In order to create different game variations, we will also use various Properties files to easily customize the readable
values of different aspects of the game, like names of properties for the board, the image files for pieces, and different
properties files for different combinations of rules. Each theme of Monopoly will have an appropriate set of properties, 
game pieces, and community chest/chance cards, and when the player decides to make a new game, they will be shown a 
series of options they can pick for different rules. According to their selection, a new properties file will be made with 
the specific rules policies and will be fed into the game on startup.</p>
<p><strong>Include a picture of how the modules are related (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard 
drawing program, or screen shots from a UML design program).</strong>
<img alt="" src="file:///var/folders/gk/mc5vrlqd189dkzb24s49mvj00000gn/T/com.apple.iChat/Messages/Transfers/IMG_0760.jpeg" /></p>
<p><strong>Discuss specific classes, methods, and data structures, but not individual lines of code.</strong>
As was said before, the board class will be responsible or moving the player and handling the changing of turns between
players. It will have a callNextPlayer() function to change whoever's turn it is, a move(Player p, Space s) function to
move a player to a specific state, and a move(Player p, int steps) function to move a player a specified number of spaces
to be used after the player rolls their dice. When a player lands on a space, the Space object will call an onLand(Player p)
function to call a set of actions on that player which will change from space to space. For instance, if it is a property
owned by another player, onLand will call that player's giveMoneyTo(double m, Agent a) function to give money to the owner
of that property. Each card that can get picked up will also invoke an action on the player that picks it up. </p></section>

            <section><p><strong>Describe three example games in detail that differ significantly. Clearly identify how the functional differences in these 
games is supported by your design. Use these examples to help clarify the abstractions in your design.</strong>
Each game mode will differ from others in two primary ways: the rules ResourceBundle used for the game and the theme of that
game (which will be shown in the properties ResourceBundle, the game piece ResourceBundle, and the Chance/Community Chest
cards ResourceBundles).
One game will be the vanilla, standard Monopoly game. This game will feature a list of properties, game pieces, and chance/
community chest cards from the standard monopoly game we all know and love.
Another game can be vanilla monopoly, but with rules modifications such as all the properties being dealt on start, double
reward for landing on go, and auctions. Cosmetically, this wouldn't be any different from the first version, but the game
play itself would be very different, as the properties file generated for this set of rules would suggest.
A third game would be Golf Monopoly, a not-so-popular-yet-enjoyable version of the game where the properties are famous
golf courses and the chance/community chest cards are based on the game of golf, like hitting a ball into the clubhouse
or having your set robbed while you went to the bathroom. If this game were played with vanilla rules, the game play and
interactions between different elements in the model would practically be exactly the same as in the first example in this
response, but cosmetically, the game would look very different.</p></section>
